I'm a research scientist at [AITRICS](https://www.aitrics.com/).
I completed my M.S. in [computer science](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/) at POSTECH, under the supervision of professor [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin/).
I also hold a bachelor's degree in [mathematics](http://math.postech.ac.kr/) from POSTECH.

My research interests include:

- Generalization of Deep Networks ([NeurIPS20a](/publications/#lee2020neural))
- Meta-learning ([ICML18](/publications/#lee2018gradient), [arXiv19](/publications/#lee2019discrete), [NeurIPS20b](/publications/#lee2020bootstrapping))
- Attention Mechanisms ([ICML19](/publications/#pmlr-v97-lee19d), [NeurIPS19](/publications/#kim2019learning), [NeurIPS19-W](/publications/#lee2019deep))

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
