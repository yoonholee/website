I am currently doing my alternative military service as a research scientist at
[Kakao](https://www.kakaocorp.com/).
I got my M.S. degree from the [computer science department at
POSTECH](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/),
as part of the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/) (supervised
by [Seungjin Choi](http://mlg.postech.ac.kr/~seungjin/)).
I got my undergraduate degree from [POSTECHâ€™s mathematics
department](http://math.postech.ac.kr/).

My research interests include meta-learning and hierarchical reinforcement
learning.
